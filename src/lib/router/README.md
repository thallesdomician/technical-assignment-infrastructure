## Router

### Overview

The `Router` class is a part of the `webapp` library and provides routing capabilities to handle different HTTP methods and routes. It allows you to define routes and associate request handlers with them.

### Usage

1. **Create an Instance of `Router`**

   ```javascript
   const router = new Router();
   ```

2. **Add Routes**

   Use methods like `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` to define routes and associate them with request handlers.

   ```javascript
   router.get('/users', getUsersHandler);
   router.post('/users', createUserHandler);
   ```

3. **Route Middleware**

   To use the `Router` as middleware in your `WebApp`, you can include it using the `use` method.

   ```javascript
   webApp.use(router.routes());
   ```

### Example

Here's a basic example of setting up a `Router` and associating routes with request handlers:

```javascript
const { Router } = require('./llb/router');

const router = new Router();

router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Your logic here
});

router.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Your logic here
});
```

In this example, we create a `Router`, define `GET` and `POST` routes, and associate them with request handlers. You can then use this `Router` as middleware within your `WebApp`.
