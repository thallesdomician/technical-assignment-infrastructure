# Technical assignment - infrastructure team

## Intro

As part of your assessment, we have prepared a technical assignment for you.

When developing RESTful APIs using node.js, developers often rely on popular web frameworks such as express, koa or fastify.
The source provided in this task uses similar patterns to describe and implement a basic 'dummy' REST API.
What's missing is the framework itself. Instead of using one of the popular options, this API will rely on your implementation of such framework.

## Goal

In the following sections, you will find the functional requirements of a barebones web framework. These are needed for the application to function properly.
The provided source code should not be modified in any way (only commenting out the sections of code is allowed for testing purposes).
Only the contents of [lib](./src/lib/) directory can be modified. Your implementation should reside here.
The end result should be a working REST API which runs on a specified port, listens for any incoming messages and processes them as defined by the application.

## General instructions

The assignment is to be completed within ten days from when you start working on it.
If you have any questions related to the assignment, feel free to contact us via <dominik.susmel@cialdnb.com>.
Document your framework and routing middleware in the provided ./lib/**/README.md files. You will find additional tips there.

Create a fork of this repository and use it for the development purposes. Once you are done, make sure your `main` branch is up-to-date and send us a link to your fork.
If there are any issues with repo access rights, we will contact you and ask you to send us a zip file containing your solution.

You are allowed to use the latest LTS version of node.js. 
Feel free to use ES2020 and stage-3 ECMAScript proposals (such as private fields and methods), but make sure the proposals are implemented in the selected node.js version.
If you are using any of the stage-3 (ESNext) features, be sure to set up the linter accordingly.

Besides using the native node.js API, you are allowed to use the following npm packages as project (dev-)dependencies:
- path-to-regexp or equivalent for route path handling
- eslint and related linting tools/plugins
- various utility packages you consider necessary (ie. lodash)

You are not allowed to use any existing third-party frameworks and develop "wrappers" around them, but you are allowed to browse their open-source repositories for inspiration.

Each TODO item in the provided source code is `[numbered]` to easily locate the additional info provided in the list below.

## Functional requirements

### WebApp

WebApp represents a minimal web framework. It builds and runs a basic middleware-based web application.
This class should implement the following functionalities:

  1. a `constructor`
    - configures the initial state of the framework instance (field values, dynamically generated methods (if any), etc.)
  2. the `use` method
    - receives a single parameter which should always be a function representing a specific middleware
    - the `use` method should register the provided `middleware` function and keep track of the registration order
    - by convention, this `middleware` function always receives three parameters: `req`, `res` and `next`.
      * `req` is an extended instance of node's `http.IncomingMessage` object. Extensions imply additions of properties such as `body`
      * `res` is an extended instance of node's `http.ServerResponse` object. Extensions imply additions of properties such as `body`
      * `next` is a function which triggers the execution of the next registered middleware in the middleware stack
    - to better understand what middleware implementation looks like, refer to [auth middleware](./src/middleware/auth.js)
    - `use` method can be called multiple times to register additional middleware and should be chainable.
  3. the `start` method
    - forwards the parameters to the node's `http.Server.listen()` method
    - returns a running instance of node's `http.Server`
  4. enrichment of node's `http.IncomingMessage` (`req`) and `http.ServerResponse` (`res`) objects
    - as mentioned in point 2, `req` and `res` should be extended with additional properties such as:
      * `req.body` - for all HTTP methods which support incoming data via request body
      * `res.body` - should be used to send the final response data after middleware execution
  5. basic error-handling wrapper for registered middleware
    - for any errors thrown from the middleware, statusCode should be set to 500 and errors should be logged to stderr.

### Router

Router represents a basic implementation of the url-based routing middleware *builder*.
This class should implement the following functionalities:

  6. a `constructor`
    - configures the initial state of the router builder instance (field values, dynamically generated methods (if any), etc.)
  7. a set of route registration methods used to register the routes and their corresponding handlers (one for each supported HTTP method)
  8. enrichment of node's `http.IncomingMessage` (`req`) and `http.ServerResponse` (`res`) objects
    - `req` and/or `res` should be extended with additional router-specific properties such as:
      * `req.params` - an object containing route parameters (for paths which specify them, ie. `GET /documents/:documentId` => `{ documentId: 'N' }`)
  9. the `routes` method
    - receives a single parameter which should be an object. This should be used for any final router configuration, such as defining the optional prefix.
    - this method should compile the final routing middleware from all the registered routes. It should return a single function compliant with definition in point 2.

### Dockerfile (bonus)

Once your application is up and running, create a dockerfile and deploy this project as a container on your local machine.
Provide us with the docker build/deployment instructions in the [section below](#technical-assignment-documentation).

## Limitations and bonuses due to time constraints

- do not overcomplicate the solution. We are not expecting that you to develop a next release of Express.js framework!
- there is no need for query string processing *
- hierarchical middleware registration is not necessary (ie. registering additional middleware for specific route prefix) *
- we will not test for resilience to duplicate routes or prefixes *
- try to implement at least GET and POST route registration
- feel free to leave the unimplemented sections of the provided source commented out. Make sure that the application still runs.
- if you don't manage to implement certain features, take some time to describe your ideas in README files.

`*` considered bonus if solved

## Review

Other than checking if the application (or part of it) is running, we will also:
- review the code quality, style and consistency
- check the code for any linting errors
- use a suite of unit and integration tests to additionally test the code
- read through the documentation
- check if the docker image is buildable and deployable (if provided)

Good luck! :rocket:
